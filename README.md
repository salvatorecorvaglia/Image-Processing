## Multispectral image analysis for precision agriculture with drone. Volume clustering, NDVI index and index clustering

The aim of the project is the calculation of NDVI index and relative clustering of a series of multispectral images acquired at the botanical garden at University of Salento by drone. The images obtained are all geo-referenced, calibrated pre-flight and post-flight and the sensor with they were acquired is a MicaSense RedEdge-M.
